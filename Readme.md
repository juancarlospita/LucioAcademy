# Elearning website major project

- orders and notification maintaing done
  I have two websites, one built with TypeScript, Next.js, and Node.js and another using Streamlit and FastAPI. The first website is already connected to mongo db and I want same MongoDB database

that is connected to first website (TS + Next.js + Node.js) to be connected to second will(Streamlit + FastAPI). Furthermore, The second website has a schema that can perform write as well read operations to "collection-5" . I want documents inside "collection-5" to be accessed by the first website. How do i achieve that?

Also note that the first website has for schemas- "collection-1","collection-2","collection-3" and "collection-4", i want first website to use the documents from "collection-5" as well for some backend operations.

Also , second website has nothing to do with the four collections or schemas of the first website

Give a step by step guide to achieve this -
